# Atom.Tracker
Simple time tracker web application for tasks. Stores the tasks in a simple json file.  Great tool for freelancers to log their time. [Try it yourself with the demo!](http://alanquandt.com/plugins/Atom.Tracker/)

## Video Series
After creating this project, I created a video tutorial series that walks you through building this project from start to finish. Check out the video series here! [Learn AJAX with jQuery and PHP](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAkMqlQoeMeggmlTJn8QLzOTohUYpHzGa)

##### Update
For portablility, I removed the dependency on MySQL. Now, the application uses a simple json document to store the tasks. I also simplified the files included in the project.

## Why
Over the years I have had to adapt to many different project management applications.  One thing I have found to be extremely difficult during development is keeping track of what I did and for how long.  When we are bouncing from task to task, many times in a matter of minutes; it can be really hard to stop what you are doing, navigate to th appropreiate task in the project manager and fill in all the details.

I started just jotting my time paper and then updating the project manager later. I then thought, 'I could make a simple time tracker and save a tree'.  So, here we are!
