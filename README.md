# Atom.Tracker
Simple time tracker for tasks. 
###NOTE
You need ```short_open_tags=On``` in php.ini

## About
Over the years I have had to adapt to many different project management applications.  One thing I have found to be extremely difficult during development is keeping track of what I did and for how long.  When we are bouncing from task to task, many times in a matter of minutes; it can be really hard to stop what you are doing, navigate to th appropreiate task in the project manager and fill in all the details.

I started just jotting my time paper and then updating the project manager later. I then thought, 'I could make a simple time tracker and save a tree'.  So, here we are!

## Goals
I would like to remove the need for a traditional database.  Maybe, use JSON to log the tasks. I would also like to build some reporting tools.
